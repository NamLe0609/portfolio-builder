This is part two of my 3-part article going through my journey, and how I got to where I am at now. If you haven't read part 1, check it out here: [Part 1](/blog/my-journey-pt1)

During my A-levels, I remember applying my knowledge for the EPQ, making fake popular websites like Amazon and Google to write about cybersecurity.
As I took Computing, I was forced to learn Java, which finally allowed me to understand what OOP was like (Though I hated writing code in Java).
Funnily enough, I did my A-Level Computing project using Python instead of Java, which was a map generator for an old-school roguelike-style game.
This project, while simple in the tools necessary as it was just using pygame, gave me a fascinating look at different algorithms, like BSP or Cellular Automata.

It wasn't until I got into Durham which everything started taking off rapidly. Thanks to the engaging lectures, challenging courseworks, 
as well as a group of extremely talented individuals hanging out around me (it still is the case now), my motivation for programming skyrocketed. 
In that year alone, I learned more than the past year combined. I got to know how to properly use Git and work collaboratively on projects, learned how to use NPM and code a dynamic one-paged website, 
got used to looking up and reading papers to solve challenging programming problems, ... the list goes on. This is not to mention the theoretical knowledge I got from the lectures themselves. 
Even during this busy year, I even got myself to go to my first hackathon ever, and made a really cool Unity project within a 24hr time limit.
