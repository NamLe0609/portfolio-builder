This is part three of my 3-part article going through my journey, and how I got to where I am at now. If you have read neither, check them out here: [Part 1](/blog/my-journey-pt1), 
[Part 2](/blog/my-journey-pt2)

In the summer of this year, I interned at a Vietnamese company as a web dev intern and while the work was fun, I got to learn an entire webstack with tools I have never even seen before, I found that 
it wasn't something I really enjoyed. More specifically, I did not mind doing backed and the infrastructure, but anything involved with frontend was hell for me 
(I know that as much as I <s>hate</s> <s>despise</s> dislike this aspect of coding, I still needed to know it as everyone everywhere needs webdevs). 

The next school year was yet another eye-opening experience for me. The first few months was applying for interns (if you are reading this, please consider me for a position ðŸ˜Ž), which lead to some development but 
ultimately didn't result in much of anything. After doing another hackathon with my friends (this time doing a much more sophisticated project), I started my rounds of coursework, and this was perhaps the most stressful but
fun moment of my career (?) (not really sure if this is the right word, but I'll go with it anyway). Doing 5 project back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back, as well as worrying about studies basically drained me of all energy
and time (look at my GitHub activity recently and that should be sufficient proof). 

All of which brings us to today, where I decided to make a website to aid my search for internships after completely finishing all these courseworks. 
If you read this far, you must be *reallyyyy* interested in my life story,
which means you probably are interested in recruiting me (please I want an internship). If you aren't an employer and instead a poor soul that spent the last 5 minutes reading my backstory, 
then you probably are a weirdo (I do appreciate the fact that you are taking your time reading these posts though!). 

Anyway, that's about all I have to say. Please continue to support me in the future! Bye bye!
