## Goals and aspirations

I am still trying to figure out what I really want to specialize in, since I kind of like everything in the field of Computer Science. However, what I really enjoyed recently include: 

- Building ML models for tasks such as sentiment analysis or stock price predictions
- Doing tasks which manipulates data and visualizing it using Pandas and Seaborn
- Learning Unix, C, and bash scripting for automatization
- Solving NP-Complete and NP-Hard problems using algorithms from scientific papers

*All the following can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/NamLe0609) page*

For now, my goal is probably to land an internship anywhere to get some valuable experience ðŸ’¼

## Languages

I am a native Vietnamese speaker, and a bilingual English speaker. Besides that, I can speak some French from my time living in Switzerland (Geneva), and a bit of Spanish from my GCSE classes (although I have forgotten most of it ðŸ¥²)

## Hobbies

I love to play video games, especially ones with rich story and interesting world buildings. I also love to binge video essays on them after finishing the game. My favorite of these games is: [Outer Wilds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/)

Apart from games, I also like to read dystopian novel like 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, The Handmaid's Tale, ... as well as classics like Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, Do Androids dream of Electric sheep. ðŸ“š

Eating is also something I really enjoy, so cooking good food is also one of my few hobbies!
